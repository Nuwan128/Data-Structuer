Stack data structuer 

A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items.
In contrast to a queue, a stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) structure.


    push()   − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.

    pop()    − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.

    peek()   − get the top data element of the stack, without removing it.
    
    display()- It prints all the elements available in the stack.
